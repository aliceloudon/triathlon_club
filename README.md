# Triathlon Club
Project 4 - a web application for the Edinburgh Triathletes club with athlete rankings, calendar and message board. Initially constructed over the course of a week and now a work in progress.

## Brief
Edinburgh Triathletes are looking to improve their digital offering in order to attract more members to join the club. They would like a member-only dashboard where members can keep up to date with events, discussions, recent time trial results and training information.

This will form part of a larger project to also redesign the club's public website.

## MVP
- Construct a database using Rails where member information can be stored and accessed from different areas of the app
- Build a front end using JavaScript and React which allows members to navigate around the app and view events and results
